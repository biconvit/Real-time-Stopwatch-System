# Real-time-Stopwatch-System
- Designed and implemented a comprehensive stopwatch system on the NUC140 board utilizing C programming and Keil Î¼Vision IDE, which has multiple operational modes through a state machine architecture with multiple operational states (Idle, Count, Pause, Check).
- Implemented multiplexed 7-segment LED display for time visualization.
- Utilized timer interrupts to achieve precise 1/10 second timing resolution.
- Created a lap time recording system with memory for 5 distinct lap times.
- Integrated debounced key matrix input handling with external interrupts.
- Applied modular programming techniques with register-level hardware configuration.
